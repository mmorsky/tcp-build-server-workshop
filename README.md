# Let's build a server!
In this workshop we'll build our own simple server and serve our web page using it. We'll use Node.js to code the server and basic web technologies in the web page.

## Project setup
* We recommend you use [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) browser in this workshop. We'll demo some of the functionality of the browser tools, but you can use any browser you want in case you don't want to install Chrome.
* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/): download the installation package from the website and follow the installation instructions.
* Download the source code from this repository to your computer
* Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where you put the source code and run the following command:
```
node server.js
```
you should see a output in your terminal saying "Server listening on address: http://localhost:8080".
* You're now ready to start the workshop!
